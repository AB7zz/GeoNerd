2. Give the values for the required input fields
3. And you're good to go!

# What is this?

This is a simple game where you can challenge your friends on who can click faster! (silly I know, but hey, it's a good project to test how good you are at applying logic in code!)

# Rules
1. User should click the button below his/her name ONLY! 
2. Click the other persons button if you want to reduce your enemy's score by 1 point (ofcourse you want to)
3. Whoever clicks the most wins. Simple.


# Drawbacks

1. If you refresh the tab, the connection will automatically get cut and the server will restart

# Happy Coding!
